## Challenge 2 - Controlling width across sections

Modify the files to meet the following conditions:
* Keep the text inside .intro-content in the same place, but have the background extend from one side of the viewport to the other, no matter how wide or narrow the browser is.
* Limit the maximum width of the text in the bottom area.
