### Issue 2
It's hard on the eyes to read text that spans the entire width of the screen. Fix the text (not the background container) so that it only extends about half-way across the container.

### Issue 3
In addition to limiting the width of the text to expand to only half of the width of the parent container, it is also desirable to limit to total width of the content to a maximum width. When reading, users don't like to have to turn their head to see all of the content. They should be able to see it all at once.

To achieve this, you can use the max-width property to set the maximum width of the content. Set the max-width to 1100px on the container.

Final Output should look like the following:
